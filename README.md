# Manufacturing Line Productivity Analysis

## Description:

This project analyzes manufacturing line productivity data to identify bottlenecks, downtime factors, and areas for improvement in operational efficiency and overall equipment effectiveness (OEE).

## Data Source:

The dataset used for this analysis contains information on line downtime, downtime factors, products, and line productivity. It includes details such as batch number, operator, downtime factors, product name, flavor, size, minimum batch time, start time, end time, and batch time.

## Analysis:

The analysis includes:

Downtime Analysis:
Identifying the most common downtime factors.
Calculating the total downtime for each factor.
Analyzing the impact of operator error on downtime.
Productivity Analysis:
Calculating the batch time for each product.
Comparing the actual batch time to the minimum batch time.
Identifying operators with the highest and lowest productivity.
Pareto Analysis:
Creating a Pareto chart to visualize the downtime factors that contribute the most to the total downtime.
Visualization:
Creating charts and graphs to communicate findings effectively.
Dashboard:

An interactive dashboard has been created to provide a visual representation of the key performance indicators (KPIs) and insights derived from the data.

## Tools and Technologies:

Microsoft Excel: Used for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.
Microsoft Excel Dashboard: Used for creating an interactive dashboard to visualize the data.
Key Findings:

Major Downtime Factors: The major downtime factors are 'Machine adjustment', 'Machine failure', and 'Inventory shortage'.
Operator Error: Operator error contributes to a significant portion of the total downtime.
Productivity: There is a variation in productivity among operators.
Recommendations:

Implement preventive maintenance to reduce machine failures.
Optimize inventory management to prevent shortages.
Provide additional training to operators to minimize errors.
Investigate the root causes of the major downtime factors and implement corrective actions.
Additional Notes:

## This project demonstrates my ability to:

Analyze and interpret manufacturing data.
Identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement.
Calculate and analyze OEE.
Create visualizations to communicate findings effectively.
Develop dashboards to track KPIs.
Make data-driven recommendations to improve manufacturing performance.
